# Z Governor: CPU/GPU governor for Sailfish OS

Governor that can be used to set CPU/GPU and other configuration files
in response to switching on/off the screen. It is possible to extend
it further if there is an interest.

See [example/zgovernor.ini](example/zgovernor.ini) for example configuration. For now, it
installs the configuration file with the package. In future, it is
planned to move configuration file into device adaptation and remove
it from this package.
